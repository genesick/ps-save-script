# ps-save-script
A python script that automatically autosaves the currently opened document on Photoshop.

Please make sure to read the instructions on how the script works.
Keep in mind that I am unable to see how the script works if there are different Photoshop programs on one's computer.
The Photoshop where I've tested the script on has been the one installed throguh Creative Clouds by Adobe.

Please let me know if you've bumped into any bugs.
