This is a script that will autosave your currently opened photoshop file in certain intervals.
By standard its set to 2 second but you can increase this interval if you'd like so.

When launching the program, click on the "START SCRIPT" button. If Photoshop is not open, it will start up Photoshop for you.
After that, it will show if a document is selected. Select a document and the script window will show what document you have selected.
After that it will immediately start with auto-saving but also showing some small status messages.
You can exit the document and select another document you wish to work on.
Mind you that the auto-save function will be enabled as long as the script window is open. If the script window is not open, auto-save won't be enabled.

You can have multiple files open, but keep in mind that the currently opened document in Photoshop is the one that will be auto-saved.


FYI; I have been unable to test this script if there are multiple Photoshop programs (ex. CS5 and CS6).
